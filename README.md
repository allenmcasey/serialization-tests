# serialization-test

This repo is a "playground" to explore three serialization libraries: Protobuf, FlatBuffers, and MsgPack. The goal is to determine the suitability of each library for applications in a messaging-intensive HPC environment involving the passing of fairly complex structures, and this evaluation process is still in the early stages of development. 

So far, each library is tested using a small and simple TestObject of the same structure in order to assess performance consistently and fairly. The fields within each test obect are as follows:

4 integer values <br />
4 string values <br />
1 integer vector <br />
1 string vector <br />

After defining each test object, measurements are taken of the execution time required to serialize and deserialize the object in each library, as well as the increase in file size when/if code is auto-generated by the library at compile time. The results observed thus far are recorded in the README of each library's folder in the repo.
