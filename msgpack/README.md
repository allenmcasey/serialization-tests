## MessagePack notes

### File sizes ###
MessagePack does not produce an automatically-generated header file like the other two libraries tested here, so the file growth is N/A or 0%.

### Execution Performance ###
The average time to create and serialize the test object was approximately 18 ms.
The average time to deserialize the test object was 58 ms.
The size of the resulting serialized object is 79 bytes.
